- ðŸ™‚ Hi, Iâ€™m @daveymeister, aka stereo meister anointed by my 1,600W RMS home stereo.
     I'm friendly and laid-back, but for some reason I have a somewhat close-by neighbor
     who's not too fond of me because of the stereo.
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m a software engineer who suffers from perfectionism syndrome. A little OCD.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to fix up my house the right way, no shortcuts.
- ðŸ”ŠðŸ’» I'm a master of stereos and computers (hardware and software), and a jack of no trades.
- ðŸ“² I'm most interested in learning Android application development.
     I know Java, C, Visual Basic, and LabVIEW, and am an Android power user.
- ðŸ¤” I'll add more as I see fit.
- I also know several scripting languages, and am an affluent bug finder within software apps of all sorts.
